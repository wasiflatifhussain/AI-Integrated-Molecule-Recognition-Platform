Plan for Upload page-
When user drags and drops a file,
- first check if there are any other files present with that username. if so, remove it
- then make a file with that username under upload folder
- then send a request to backend
- backend starts reading the file
- each time reads 5000/10000 lines
- calls the ai model on these
- stores data in a result.csv file
- each time, appends to this csv file
- when returns results for upload, return by reading from csv file
note: data size will never exceed the size of one csv file 

For Structure Generation-
- first check if any csv files with this username is present and if yes, remove them all
- start generating the molecules, and appending them to csv files
- make all the necessary csv files and store the datas
- now make the call ai model part and when ai model called:
- read csv file by csv file, and for each csv file,
- generate a result file by username and start storing data
- generate all data and at the end, return
- in frontend, just read the result files and tell the total number of data results
- allow download of data results all at once

issue: model one does not take full dataset
